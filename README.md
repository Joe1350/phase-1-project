# phase-1-project: Doctor Who Database

My phase 1 project is a Doctor Who database. You can look for episodes by season, doctor, director, or writer.
From there, you can look at individual episode details, if they exist within the api.

project guidelines: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-javascript-project-mode

## Installation

There is no installation, project can be viewed at:
https://joe1350.github.io/phase-1-project/

## Visuals

I'll try and add a gif here soon

## Usage

This is a single page web application. When it first loads you will see all the categories you can browse through.
When you click on a category you will see all items in that category, a subcategory of sorts.
If you click on any item in the subcategory you will see all episodes that apply to that item.
From there, if you click on an episode you will see the episode details for that episode(assuming it is contained within the api.)
If it is not contained within the api, where the episode details would've loaded, it'll tell you it can't be found.
You can also like an episode(likes do not persist.)
To view all categories again, refresh the page, or refresh the page with the provided button.

## Support

There is not any support for this project.

## Roadmap

I would like to maybe one day make the likes persist.
I would also like to add a link to third-party episode details, espescially for episodes that aren't in the api.
I would also like to add links for buying and/or watching the episodes
